# Notes on TLS-SRP implementation

See README.txt for details.

Being a 'text' file and not a stupid ridiculous fancy hipster bollox 'markdown'
file, it actually treats the hash character as intended and not some type of
stupidly big heading.  It also formats text as, you know, text, so your config
files actually read okay.

Which muppet decided markdown was the detault? Have they been shot yet?
